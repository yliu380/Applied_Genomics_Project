Aligning reads to the reference genome...
4086016 reads; of these:
  4086016 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    682632 (16.71%) aligned 0 times
    2423328 (59.31%) aligned exactly 1 time
    980056 (23.99%) aligned >1 times
83.29% overall alignment rate

Sum of MAPQ: 106238418
Number of Mapped Reads: 4086016

Takes forever to run (~2 hours).
Need to come up with a solution to deal with the extremely long run-time.
